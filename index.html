            By Definitionis a simulation of an existing location, usually composed of a sequence of videos or still images. It may also use other multimedia elements such as sound effects, music, narration, and text.
            It is distinguished from the use of live television to affect tele-tourism. in detail 3D virtual tours is the realistic 3D geovisualisation of virtual environments, which allows the user to explore physical places without physical travel.
            During the current pandemic, there has been a rise in 360 virutal tours in real estate since the rules and guidelines of todays pandemic restricts groups, and promotes social distancing. The real estate agency has 
            used this time to adapt and stay a float by offering virtual tours that put the power into the customers hands and allow them to choose what they are looking at in the homes and when they are looking at the homes.<br><br>
            Virtual tours though, are not new , they came into focus in 1994 with the first example of the tours being a museum. This museum was of Dudley Castle in England as it was in 1550. This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc based system designed by British-based engineer Colin Johnson.
            The tour was used by  Queen Elizabeth II, when she officially opened the visitor centre in June 1994. Because the Queen's officials had requested titles, descriptions and instructions of all activities, the system was named and described as: "Virtual Tour, being a cross between Virtual Reality and Royal Tour." Details of the original project can be viewed online.
            The system was featured in a conference held by the British Museum in November 1994 and in a subsequent technical paper.
