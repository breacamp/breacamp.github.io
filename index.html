            Recently companies and people have had to rethink the way that they interact to do buissness, this may include how people go to restauraunts , how many people are allowed in a public 
            building , and of course wearing masks. In particular the real estate market had to go from bringing people together in a home for tours and having open houses to finding out a way that they 
            could still interact with people and showing them homes (apartment or houses) but still obeying the social distancing laws in place. That is where the 360 tours began in the real estate market, these
            virutal tours are allowing home buyers the capability of touring homes without leaving the comfort of their homes. This will give the user the capability to move around, zoom , change rooms, and give a over view
            of the room .. giving the power to the customer and allowing them to view the home in there homes with no inturruptions, no distractions, and no rushing.
