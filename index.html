                <h2 id="wrong" class="Info">What can go wrong?</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>There is a number of ways that hosting or participating in a virtual tour could go wrong.. These include</h3> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="text-align: left;">
                           <h4 ><strong>Mis-representation</strong></h4> <br> Some companies may not have a proper idea of what a virtual tour or 360 tour is. To some people these tours may mean a simple video of the location,
                            a pictured slide show. Or companies may not get the full view of the home ruining the experience for the user because they may not be able to 1. take control of what they see
                            2. Or see what they were wanting to.. especiall in a pictured slide show. <br>
                            
                        </li>
                        <li  style="text-align: left;">
                            <strong>Companies not meeting the basic Qualifications to be a successful Virtual tour <br></strong>
                            <ul >
                                <li >
                                    If a company does not give the view control to their users this could leave the users feeling fustrated and not give them a 
                                    accurate view of the home.. leading them to seek out other locations.
                                </li>
                                <li> If a company uses anything other than real photos of the property , the tour can come off as cartoonish and leave the users un interested and also 
                                    not give a valid and true representation of the home.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If a site or a tour is not able to be access from both a computer AND a mobile device this could greatly reduce the attention the homes get since, a large percentage of home buyers are 
                                    using websites as first point of contact when searching for a home! a study showed that 73% used mobile or tablet search device vs the those who did not and 93% used online websited vs those who did not!
